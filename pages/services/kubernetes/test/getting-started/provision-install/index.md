In this first part of the tutorial, you will learn the basics of how to:

  - set up a DC/OS Enterprise cluster able to allow for installation of Kubernetes
  - install the Mesosphere Kubernetes Engine (MKE) on your DC/OS cluster
  - create two Kubernetes clusters on top of your DC/OS cluster using the DC/OS Kubernetes CLI

This will provide you with a thorough, but basic, Enterprise installation of DC/OS Kubernetes. For more detailed installation instructions, or to find out how to further customize your installation of DC/OS Kubernetes, see the [Customizing](/services/kubernetes/__VERSION__/operations/customizing-install/) section.

# First Step: Setting up your DC/OS Enterprise cluster for Kubernetes

Next, you will [set up your DC/OS Enterprise cluster](/services/kubernetes/__VERSION__/getting-started/provision-install/setting-up/). This will help ensure you experience a successful demonstration of operating Kubernetes on DC/OS Enterprise.
