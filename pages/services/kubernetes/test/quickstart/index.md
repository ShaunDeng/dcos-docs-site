Kubernetes is now available as a DC/OS package to quickly, and reliably run Kubernetes clusters on Mesosphere DC/OS. This guide is provided along with a downloadable repository which will take you through a (mostly) automated process of setting up everything you need to test a Kubernetes cluster on a DC/OS cluster in a cloud environment. The quickstart installer will set the necessary configurations and install the necessary DC/OS cluster before installing a Kubernetes cluster onto it. This is an open source installation meant to provide a quick way to evaluate Kubernetes on DC/OS.
