# Kubernetes Quick Start Installer on DC/OS

Kubernetes is now available as a DC/OS package to quickly, and reliably run Kubernetes clusters on Mesosphere DC/OS. This guide will take you through a (mostly) automated process of setting up and installing DC/OS 1.12, then installing the Mesosphere Kubernetes Engine and Kubernetes clusters onto the DC/OS cluster. This is an open source installation meant to provide a quick way to evaluate Kubernetes on DC/OS.
