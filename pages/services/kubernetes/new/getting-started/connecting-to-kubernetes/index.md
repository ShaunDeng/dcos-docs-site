# Connecting to Kubernetes

Now that we have setup and configured our cluster with a pair of Kubernetes clusters on our DC/OS Enterprise cluster, in this next part of [**Getting Started with Kubernetes on DC/OS Enterprise**](services/kubernetes/new/getting-started/) you will learn to configure your DC/OS Enterprise cluster's network to:

- communicate with our Kubernetes clusters using the Kubernetes CLI - `kubectl'
- view your Kubernetes dashboard via web proxy

all from outside the DC/OS cluster's secured perimeter using [DC/OS Edge-LB]() for DC/OS Enterprise.

# Next: [Configure Edge-LB to Connect to Kubernetes](/services/kubernetes/new/getting-started/connecting-to-kubernetes/config-edgelb/)

In the next part of the tutorial, you will [configure Edge-LB to connect to our Kubernetes clusters](/services/kubernetes/new/getting-started/connecting-to-kubernetes/config-edgelb/) we made in the last step of this [**Getting Started with Kubernetes on DC/OS Enterprise**](services/kubernetes/new/getting-started/) tutorial.
